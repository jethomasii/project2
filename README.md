# xkcd Password Generator

## Description
This is my second project for CSCI E-15. It generates passcodes in the style of the famous web comic, xkcd. To do this is uses a set of commonly used words imported from csv into a php array. The rest happens through the magic of computing. 

## Demo
Coming soon...

## Misc
You just click on it, then click things, it's pretty self-explanatory.

## Outside code
I used the template from the demo page because there's only so many ways to create this. The PHP is all mine. The word list comes from http://www.wordfrequency.info/ and was assembled at https://github.com/pkLazer/password_rank/blob/master/4000-most-common-english-words-csv.csv. Seemed easier than scraping for scraping sake.
